# How to code (for creatives)
Updated: 31-10-2020

## The code editor to start with
### For web/javascript projects
The best code editor for web and javascript-projects right now is **Visual Studio Code**. Its available on all systems, its *open source* and *free* and its the *industry standard.* Get it here: [VSCode]([https://link](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
### For processing
I suggest using the [processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/) (Integrated Development Environment, say the "inbuilt" editor) if you are just starting out. However, if you like to have more control over your editor and use awesome features like [MultiCursor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) than you can install the extension **Processing Language** to use **VSCode** for your processing project.

## Tutorials to start with
### Beginners
**If you start from nothing** and want to understand the fundamentals about programming Daniel Shiffman is the best teacher imaginable. He is fun, he is motivating and he knows how to explain really well. You can find his Channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/) on Youtube.

Start with: [Learning Processing: A Beginner's Guide to Programming ...](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/playlists?view=50&flow=grid&shelf_id=10) 

If you want to start with **web-programming** try:
* [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/)

### Advanced
* [Git and Github for Poets (The Coding Train)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY) *Daniel Shiffman gives an Introduction to **Git and Github.** The software and platform nearly every open-source project is using today*
* [The Nature of Code: Simulating Natural Systems with Processing](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=9) *If you want to dive deeper into **processing and creative coding**. There is also an updated version for javascript/p5js but you have to search for it within the youtube channel, since there is no playlist*

* [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) *A good resource if you want to **learn a certain topic**. Just make sure you only buy discounted courses and never pay the "regular" price. The way to do this: If you'd like to have a course, add it to your wishlist and most certainly within a few days you'll get a promotion for this exact course via email.*
* [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) *If you **really** want to learn **JavaScript***
* [frontendmasters.com](https://frontendmasters.com/) *Get state-of-the-art **webdevelopment knowledge** here. If you register for [github students](https://education.github.com/students) you can get 6 months of subscription for free* 
* [SUPERHi](https://www.superhi.com/creative-coding) *most courses are paid and not exactly cheap but they have a **special focus on creatives and designers**, so they might well be worth it*

## VSCode-Extensions to ease the pain
One of the reasons why VSCode became so popular so quickly because of its simple extensibility. You can easily search for and install new  extensions by using the shortcut `ctrl (cmd) + shift + x` and searching for the extensions name:
Here is a list of extensions I can recommend for everyone and every project:
* Auto Rename Tag
* Bracket Pair Colorizer
* Live Server
* Color Highlight
* Window Colors
* Beautify/Prettier (these two are code formatters, that help)
* Advanced New File

For more advanced use or specific code projects I also use:
* Import Cost
* p5js Snippets
* PHP Intelephense
* Processing Language
* SCSS Formatter
* stylelint
* Todo Tree
* Better Comments

## What does it mean?
When I started I constantly came across topics and terms that where discussed as if everyone should know what it's all about and I had no idea what they where, so I will try my best to explain some concepts you will stumble across frequently as concise as possible:
* **Node:** *is a runtime-environment that lets you run **Javascript outside of a browser*** 
* **NPM/Yarn:** *Both are **package managers** that allow you the install bits of reusable Javascript-Programms*
* **Linter:** 
* **Snippets:** *one type of code suggestion you can get with Intellisense*
* **Intellisense:** *by pressing `ctrl (cmd) + space` in VSCode you get code suggestions based on your context*
* **IDE:**
* **VanillaJS:** *like vanilla is the basic flavour of icecream VanillaJS refers to Javascript without any framework. The same is true for VanillaPHP and so on ...*
* **React/Angular/Vue/Svelte/jQuery:** are Javascript frameworks
* **DOM:** DOM describes the tree-like structure of your HTML-Code with parent and child elements and different "branches". Very often its used synonymously with your HTML-document.
* **Framework:** **
* **Git:** *is a tool to manage versions of your code efficently. So instead of "keeping a backup" by copying your folder to another location (we've all done that) it keeps all your versions hidden inside your main directory as **commits**. You can access all your prior commits at any moment and switch back and forth between them.*
* **Commit:** *In a commit you save the current state of your code project, so you can come back later in case you mess something up.* 
* **Github:** *is an online portal that is thightly integrated with Git. It helps with distributing, sharing and cooperating on code projects.*
